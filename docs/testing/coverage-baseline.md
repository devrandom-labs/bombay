# Coverage baseline (card #85)

Reproducible via crane, with **two engines** selected by system:

```bash
nix build .#coverage -L            # system default: llvm-cov on Darwin, tarpaulin on Linux
nix build .#coverage-llvm -L       # force llvm-cov (any system) -> result/html/index.html
nix build .#coverage-tarpaulin -L  # force tarpaulin (Linux only) -> result/tarpaulin-report.html
```

- **`coverage-llvm`** (crane `cargoLlvmCov`) — works on every system, region/branch accurate,
  instrumented by the version-matched `llvm-cov`/`llvm-profdata` from the toolchain's
  `llvm-tools` component (`rust-toolchain.toml`).
- **`coverage-tarpaulin`** (crane `cargoTarpaulin`) — Linux-only (ptrace engine; no Darwin
  support), so it is only exposed on Linux.
- **`coverage`** switches by system — tarpaulin on Linux (CI is x86_64-linux), llvm-cov on
  Darwin (local dev) — so the same command works everywhere.

All run `cargo … test --workspace` with default features; non-gating (instrumentation
recompiles the world — too slow for the per-push gate). `remote` (libp2p) is off by default, so
it is never compiled or counted (M1 deletes it). On every **merge to `main`**, the
`coverage.yml` workflow rebuilds this and publishes the browsable HTML to GitHub Pages at
`…/bombay/coverage/` (and as the `coverage-html` artifact). The numbers below are from
`coverage-llvm`; tarpaulin's totals differ slightly (different instrumentation granularity).

## Baseline — 2026-06-29 (after #77)

Workspace line coverage **60.85% (5686/9345)** — but that blends the SUT with untested crates
and compile-time-only code. The honest per-area picture:

| Area | Line cov | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **kameo core `src/`** (the #77-wired modules) | **76.7%** (4098/5342) | the wired surface |
| in-tree `src/console/` | 95–98% (minus `demo.rs`, a non-SUT demo at 0%) | #76 |
| `console` crate (`tui`/`poller`) | 69.5% | #82/#83 raise this |
| **`actors` crate** | **0%** (0/971) | untested — **#78** |
| `macros` crate | ~4% | see "known limitation" below |

### The real gaps inside the #77-wired core (ranked)
| Line cov | File | Read |
|---|---|---|
| **25.0%** (6/24) | `src/request.rs` | tiny module (thin builder/`IntoFuture` glue); ~18 uncovered lines, low value |
| **46.5%** (463/995) | `src/actor/actor_ref.rs` | **biggest real gap** — 532 uncovered lines despite 22 wired scenarios. The many ask/tell/query overloads, `Recipient`/`ReplyRecipient` erasure variants, blocking variants, and error paths are under-exercised. Highest-value place to add scenarios. |
| 71.6% (303/423) | `src/request/tell.rs` | uncovered timeout/blocking/error branches |
| 72.1% (258/358) | `src/error.rs` | uncovered combinator/Display branches |
| 72.4% (184/254) | `src/actor/kind.rs` | run-loop branches |
| 76.0% (127/167) | `src/message.rs` | dispatch edges |

Well-covered (≥80%): `supervision` 95%, `spawn` 93%, `actor` 91%, `links` 89%, `reply` 89%,
`id` 88%, `registry` 87%, `request/ask` 81%, `mailbox` 81%.

### Known limitation — proc-macros read ~0%
The `macros` crate (`messages.rs` 0/437, the `derive_*`) runs at **compile time**, in a separate
process during the build of crates that USE the macros — runtime `llvm-cov` of the test binaries
cannot see it. Covering it needs expansion/`trybuild` tests, a distinct concern (not "write more
runtime scenarios"). Likewise `demo.rs` and `console/src/main.rs` are demo/binary entrypoints
(the latter tracked by #83), not library SUT.

## What this tells us
Wiring scenarios (#77) ≠ covering the code: the wired core is a healthy **77%**, but
`actor_ref.rs` at **46%** is the one wired module with a large hole, and four modules sit in the
low-70s. Gap-closing priority: **`actor_ref` scenarios first**, then the low-70s error/edge
branches. The `actors` 0% is the separate big hole (#78).
